# Incident: 2025-04-08 09-00-00

## Summary

```md
Between the hour of 9:00 AM-9:15 AM on 8 Apr 2025, one user encountered trouble placing pizza orders. The event was triggered by a rejection of pizzas by the factory at 9:00 AM. The HTTP error for the pizza order endpoint contained a link that, upon successful execution, restored normal functionality.

A bug in this code caused failure to create pizza orders. The event was detected by myself upon manual inspection of Grafana Metrics. The team started working on the event by 9:13 AM. This critical incident affected 100% of users.

There was further impact since the Grafana IRM system failed as noted by  were raised in relation to this incident.
```

## Detection


```md
This incident was detected when the administrator in charge manually checked the Grafana dashboard.

Unfortunately the IRM service did not trigger due to a bug in the error detection strategy where the `count_over_time` was set in a too short of a time period, 1 minute, when it should have been longer.

An improved detection query will be set up by the administrator, Matheus Plinta, so that the IRM can trigger as intended.
```

## Impact


```md
For 15 mins between 09:00 MDT and 09:15 MDT on 04/08/25, our users experienced the inability to place pizza orders due to a bug in the order creation system.

This incident affected all customers 100% of pizza ordering service users, who experienced failed pizza order attempts.

No support tickets or social media posts were submitted during this incident.
```

## Timeline


```md
All times are MDT.

- _09:10_ - Administrator, Matheus Plinta, detects a sharp increase in pizza failures in the Grafana dashboard.
- _09:13_ - Administrator inspected the response body of the error and found the solution.
- _09:15_ - Finally, administrator detects all systems are properly operational and pizza orders started working again.

```

## Response


```md
After detecting the issue at 09:10 MDT, the administrator, Matheus Plinta, began investigating the problem. By 09:13 MDT, the solution was identified in the HTTP error response, and normal functionality was restored by 09:15 MDT.
```

## Root cause


```md
A bug in the pizza order creation code caused the system to reject all orders. Additionally, the IRM system failed to trigger due to an incorrectly configured error detection window of 1 minute.
```

## Resolution


```md
The administrator executed the solution link found in the HTTP error response, which restored normal functionality to the pizza ordering system. The IRM detection query will be updated to use a longer time period for error detection.
```

## Prevention

```md
To prevent recurrence, the IRM error detection strategy will be updated to use a more appropriate time window. Additionally, the team will be aware of chaos testing to properly respond to it.
```

## Action items

```md
1. Update the IRM error detection query to use a longer time window for count_over_time.
2. Fix the bug in the pizza order creation code to prevent order rejections.
3. Review and test the IRM system to ensure it triggers correctly for similar incidents in the future.
